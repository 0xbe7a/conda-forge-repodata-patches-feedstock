# from this code
# TensorFlow Probability was published with loose constraints on
#   TensorFlow-base leading to broken dependencies.
# Each release actually specifies the exact version of TensorFlow and JAX that
#   it supports, therefore we need to
# pin the dependencies to the exact version that was used to build the package.
# See also issue:
# if (record.get("timestamp", 0) < 1676674332000) and (
